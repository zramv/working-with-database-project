# working with database project
A simple web application that takes a user's name and age, and change their status (0 or 1) based on active button. The result is stored in a database **instantly** using asynchronous requests.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- PHP (Backend)  
- MySQL (Database)  
- Fetch API (AJAX)

## How It Works
This project uses asynchronous communication between the frontend and the backend using the `fetch()` API. The frontend sends and receives data in JSON format, and the backend is handled through three main PHP files:
 - inert.php : Insert new record into the database.
 - get_data.php : Retrieves all records from database.
 - toggle_status : Update the status of a user.
